Hi contributor, its so nice to see you actively contribute!
Let me walk through the format we want you to create the database for MyClass@SIT:-

The Hierarchy:<br>
Freshman/Sophomore -> Branch -> Batch(eg:A2,B3,etc) -> Day of the week -> Timeslot -> Subject,Location,Faculty

Please make sure to make changes to the database in exactly this hierarchial order. We have already sorted things out till the branch hierarchy level for you.

The Syntax:
``` 
"Monday": {
          "08:45-09:45": { "subject": "FEEEL", "location": "BEEE LAB 3rd floor", "faculty": "Sangeeta Pant" },
          "09:45-10:45": { "subject": "FEEEL", "location": "BEEE LAB 3rd floor", "faculty": "Sangeeta Pant" },
          "10:45-11:45": { "subject": "FEEE", "location": "C108", "faculty": "Pritesh Shah" },
          "11:45-12:45": { "subject": "Chemistry", "location": "C108", "faculty": "Shekhar Bhame" },
          "12:45-13:40": { "subject": "Lunch", "location": "-", "faculty": "-" },
          "13:40-14:35": { "subject": "PPS", "location": "B106", "faculty": "Vipin Tiwari" },
          "14:35-15:30": { "subject": "PPSL", "location": "CAD Lab 1st floor", "faculty": "Vipin Tiwari" },
          "15:30-16:25": { "subject": "PPSL", "location": "CAD Lab 1st floor", "faculty": "Vipin Tiwari" }
        },
```
This is the syntax you have to follow, make sure to close all your curly brackets so that there is no error in your code.
